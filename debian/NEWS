fuse-exfat (1.3.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  In the wake of Linux 5.7 supporting exFAT natively, the fuse-exfat
  package drops the "mount.exfat" symlink for the "mount.exfat-fuse"
  helper. Subsequently a plain mount of an exFAT filesystem will rely
  on the Linux implementation. If you'd like to continue to use the
  fuse-exfat implementation you've to invoke "/sbin/mount.exfat-fuse"
  directly.
